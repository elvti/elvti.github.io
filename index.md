## Week 1 Reflection

  Prior to reading “Technology and Ideology: The Case of the Telegraph” by James W. Carey, I hadn’t thought about the significance of such an archaic communication technology. After all, it was just another primitive form of communication, just like pagers or mail. While the former had existed shortly before my time, thus I still experienced its legacy, and the latter is still commonly used today, the telegraph was something I never had a complete grasp on aside from watching old movies and cartoons. Never would I have known that the telegraph had such profound impacts on those living during that time. It had opened up “the first great industrial monopoly”, an entirely new industry, and changed the way we thought about social and business interactions (Carey 2). However, upon examining the changes telegraphs brought to the 1800s society, I noticed many aspects that resonate with the 21st century surge of modern technologies, which until now I had thought of as unique.

  Carey argued that while the ideology behind the telegraph may seem like an entirely new one, it was built on foundations already existing in our society (2). In some sense, the telegraph is very similar to the Internet. Just like there is no other alternatives to compare our Internet to (Dourish, there was nothing quite like the telegraph when it was invented. For us modern humans, it is difficult to imagine the world without the internet, and its expansion and domination of our lives makes it hard for us to perceive what more can be done, and what greater technologies will follow. 

  Also like the Internet, the telegraph created a whole new industry. For the telegraph’s case, it was connecting previously separated markets and monetizing the electrical communications industry. It laid groundworks for many new forms of communication to follow, such as the telephone. It created the 1800s equivalent of e-marketing and allowed the flow of commodities to transcend the flow of time. The Internet, too, created the foundation for many other forms of technology and industry, such as artificial intelligence, e-marketing, search engines and online databases, and the development of new hardware that implements these technologies. Furthermore, if the telegraph allowed detachment of communication and transportation, the Internet then allowed detachment of reality and virtuality. With more and more information being available in the “cloud”, we are once again redefining information transfer.

  While the Internet boasts its freedom and empowerment of the individual, the same concerns of the telegraph still exists today. Back in the day, the monopoly and centralized set-up of telegraph transmission led to a “selective control and transmission of information” (Carey 10). The business monopoly eventually turned into a spiritual one. However, that concern in the case of the Internet has taken form in government censorship and media partisanship. Despite its decentralized scheme, the flow of information is not fully at will. A handful of entities hold the power to determine what the majority of users sees. In a spiritual sense, the power is still centralized, even if the sender and receiver do not realize it.

  How does the history of the telegraph connect to modern technologies? From all of these similarities, it is easy to ask whether the Internet would become just like the telegraph, a groundbreaking invention of its time that is soon replaced. After all, just like how it was hard to predict the birth of the Internet during an era of telephones, it would be just as hard for us modern humans engrossed in the Internet to predict its downfall. However, as much as I can perceive, I think that it “the Cycle” of communications technology, described by Tim Wu in his book _The Master Switch_ (6), will end here at the Internet. Unlike the telegraph, which was created on privately owned hardware and controls to be monopolized, industrialized, and monetized, the Internet was created to be a common platform that can foster even more technological advancements. So then, more precisely, I think that the Internet transcends the Cycle, and is simply not part of it.

## Week 2 Reflection

### --------------WIP--------------

For a long time, I found the word “hypertext” very hard to grasp. Since I grew acquainted with the World Wide Web (WWW) at a very young age, the concept of hypertext became vague as it not only integrated into my browsing experience, but also my everyday mode of thinking and perceiving knowledge. However, even that is not a completely correct statement, as the concept of hypertext, hyperlink, and hypermedia arose from the nonlinear nature of our society and how our brains process new knowledge (the former is briefly explored in Tim Berners-Lee's proposal for the WWW in a corporate setting). Furthermore, the original concept of hypertext came with many different variants of nonlinear information structures. So, why the “current” hypertext as we know it? Based on my readings, experience, and personal preferences, I will give a speculation for the success of discrete hypertexts, which consist of linked chunks of texts.


### The article “What Hypertext Is” by Wardrip-Fruin identifies several aspects of hypertexts as well as its distinction with the more general term hypermedia.

* “Connection from one position in a text to another” - Espen Aarseth (qtd. in Wardrip-Fruin 1)
* A hands-on and intuitive way to interact with information by building associations and knowledge
* Hypertext is a subcategory of hypermedia, referring to the types of nonlinear media that primarily operate textually.

### Ted Nelson’s “Discrete hypertext” vs. “stretch text” (qtd. in Wardrip-Fruin 2)
* **Discrete hypertexts** are consolidated chunks that may be related to other chunks in the same body of text
  * Predominant structure in the WWW as we know it today, as seen in the original proposal for the WWW (Berners-Lee)
  * Branching, but does not take away the experience of viewing the big picture
  * Webbed structure more or less resembles how information is organized in our brain - inter-webbed neurons, perception of information, integration and processing center, and response and/or storage, all are associations
  * Webbed structure also resembles the way social interaction, ideas, and information across a large organization are organized
  * Nowadays in modern computers where multitasking is allowed, discrete hypertext is much more friendly
* **Stretch text** is the plain text version of a zoomable “hypermap” (Wardrip-Fruin 2).
  The closest thing we have to that is a collapsable text, but no lengthening by “minute degrees” (Wardrip-Fruin 2)
  * No branching, just zooming
  * Not good for reader: bad for viewing the big picture because one could very easily lose track of the big picture by zooming in on one subtopic
  * It is completely serial, not parallel. Though the human brain essentially processes serially, we can switch tasks very easily. This does not allow efficient “multitasking”
  * The amount of clicking needed to get to the right level of detail is unknown
  * For learning, it may be useful for certain subjects where axioms and key points are laid out this way. It does create a local multidimensionality. However, stretch text is not as flexible as discrete hyperlink. Discrete hyperlink could be designed in a way to mimic seriality, but stretch text cannot mimic a webbed structure. There is clarity and order in this way of organization.
  * However, although I personally prefer to organize my new knowledge serially and expandable for my own studying, such as having 1, 1.1, 1.2, and 2, 2.1, etc., like a lot of textbooks, there is a limit to how much further expansion I can handle when taking in completely new information
  * Not friendly for the writer either because it is often not easy to judge how much detail to include under one expandable topic. Also an uncertainty in the level of detail that will actually be read.
